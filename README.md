# S/4HANA Cloud extensions - Product ordering sample app
This sample web application showcases an extension to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. It lists products (from the material master) for external users and allows to order them (i.e. a sales order is created in S/4HANA Cloud).

> **NOTE:** This sample app is based on and explained in detail in the [1RW set-up instructions guide](https://rapid.sap.com/bp/#/browse/scopeitems/1RW). There, you will find more details on the end to end steps of the ordering scenario example, e.g.:
> * Creation of a custom business object in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
> * Connection setup of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system and SAP Cloud Platform (via a communication arrangement)
> * Adaption and deployment of the sample app

> The following README only shows a basic overview.


Requirements
-------------
1. We assume that you have access to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system and an SAP Cloud Platform account
2. Install [JDK8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Prepare your S/4HANA Cloud system according to the [1RW set-up instructions guide](https://rapid.sap.com/bp/#/browse/scopeitems/1RW).
**Note:** to access the guide you need to have [an account for SAP Service Marketplace](https://websmp103.sap-ag.de/~sapidp/012002523100007691892016E/)

Download the sample app
------------------

```
git clone https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sample-ext.git
cd cloud-s4-sample-ext
git checkout extorderapp
```
or if you want to clone the single branch only:
```
git clone -b extorderapp --single-branch git://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sample-ext.git
cd cloud-s4-sample-ext
```

Connect it to your S/4HANA Cloud system
---------------------------------------
Adapt [application.properties](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sample-ext/blob/extorderapp/application/src/main/resources/application.properties) and adjust the connection parameters according to your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.


```
# OData service of the Custom Business Object, created in S/4HANA Cloud to store one-time order data
s4cld.onetimecustomerrecord_servicepath=/sap/opu/odata/sap/YY1_CUSTOMERRECORD_CDS
s4cld.onetimecustomerrecord_resource=YY1_CUSTOMERRECORD

#One time Business partner
s4cld.onetimebusinesspartner =P1010E2E10

#Distribution channel
s4cld.distrubutionchannel=10

#Organization Division
s4cld.organizationdivision=00

#Product Group
s4cld.productgroup=L001

#SalesOrder Type
s4cld.salesordertype=OR
```


Build it
--------

```
mvn package
```


Deploy to SAP Cloud Platform
----------------------------
1. Login to your SAP Cloud Platform cockpit (trial available https://cloudplatform.sap.com).
2. Goto "Java Applications".
3. Select the freshly built `extorderapp-application.war` which was created by `the mvn` package command in folder `cloud-s4-sample-ext\extorderapp\application\target`.
4. Choose `Java EE 6 Web Profile ` (runtime `JRE7`).


Limitations / Disclaimer
------------------------
Note: This sample code is primarily for illustration purposes and is not intended for productive usage. It solely shows basic interaction with an S/4HANA Cloud system. Topics like authentication, error handling, transactional correctness, security, caching, tests were omitted on purpose for the sake of simplicity. For detailed information on development on the SAP Cloud Platform, please consult https://cloudplatform.sap.com/developers.html


Troubleshooting
------------

 1. This sample application reads data from the SAP S/4HANA Cloud
    backend system and hence requires appropriate data maintained for a
    sell from stock process. Further details can be found also in guide
    [Sell from stock
    BD9](https://rapid.sap.com/bp/#/browse/scopeitems/BD9).
 2. application.properties is configured based on BD9 data items.
 3. In case you hit the error page, please go through the exception
    trace for more details. Exception trace can be found under SAP
    CloudPlatform Cockpit > Java applications > extorder-application >
    Logging > **Default Traces** .
    
    **Known Exceptions:**
    ODataException connectivity : Re-check your Destinations ErpQueryEndpoint and  	  Custom Business Object configurations.

 4. If you work with your [SAP Cloud Platform Trial account](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/), you must add the following 2 properties to the destination so that the connection to SAP S/4HANA Cloud works:  

      proxyHost =	proxy-trial.od.sap.biz  
      proxyPort =	8080
